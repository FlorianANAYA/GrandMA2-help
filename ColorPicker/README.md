This color picker is made to be implemented very fastly into a show file. Its strength resides in the fact that all images are directly generated by the script, so you don't need to import them yourself.
If you don't like images and prefer good ol' pool icons (for performances, or just because you prefer them), you can disable also images.

Colors are fully customisable, you can edit, change or delete them as you want, you are not forced to used the default one provided. Also, you can specify swatchbook colors provided by MA.

## Installation  
Download *ColorPicker.lua* and *ColorPicker.xml* from GitHub and insert them into the plugin folder of a USB stick.  
In MA2, edit an empty plugin, click on *import* and select *ColorPicker.xml*.  
  
## Configuration  
In order to edit the config of the plugin, you will need a keyboard. If you are using a Light/Full Size MA2 console or a onPC setup, the built-in keyboard is fine. If you are using an Ultra Light MA2, you need an external keyboard.
To set up the plugin, you need to edit it and change values present in the top of the file.
 
### Groups  
The first step is to set the group that you want to include in your color picker.  
Add them between the brackets separated by comma.

You can create submaster groups by adding a sub-bracket group.

The sub-group will get its own masters that will react to the previous masters.

### First executor ID

This setting defines which executor will be used first. This plugin will need as many executors as you add groups. For example, if you include 5 groups in your color picker and want to use executor 2.106, you will need executor 2.106 thru 2.110 to be unused.  
Once the color picker is created, it is important that you do not move or delete these executors or the picker won't work any more.

### Layout ID  
By default, the plugin is set to use layout 0. This means that the plugin will automatically look for the first available layout.
But it is also posible to define yourself which layout to use. You simply have to edit the value. Note that the layout must be empty or the plugin won't work. Once the color picker is created, you can freely move the layout.

### Fade time between colors  
You can edit the fade time between two colors. The default setting is one second.

### Editing colors  
![](https://i.ibb.co/V2zjXsy/image12.png)
You can freely change the colors that are included in the color picker by editing this table. Be careful because a typo can cause the plugin to not work at all.  
Every color is defined by a row in the table. You can delete a color by deleting a row, or add a color by copy/pasting a row in the table.  
Colors can be defined in two ways:

· With RGB values (defined in percent)

    {['red'] = 100, ['green'] = 50, ['blue'] = 0 }
    
· With a gel

    { ['swatchbook'] = '8.120' }

You can use the full gel name (don't forget any quote or apostrophe or the plugin won't work) or the color number. It is always defined by *SwatchBookName.GelName* or *SwatchBookNumber.GelNumber*. Also, be careful to use the gel number and not the color key.  Thoses informations can be found in the default GMA2 color picker.

Colors also have names. For RGB color, names are auto generated by GMA2. For colors using a gel, The gel name is used. If you don't like the generated name, you can also define it yourself.

    { ['name'] = "Not Orange", ['red'] = 100, ['green'] = 40, ['blue'] = 0}
    
### Enable/disable images  
By default, the plugin generates and uses images, but it is possible to disable them.

You will get a color picker that looks like this, with only pool icons. ![](https://i.ibb.co/fdHGjkC/image2.png)
  
Change this setting to *false* to disable images.

There might be a performance improvement in disabling images but this has not been tested.

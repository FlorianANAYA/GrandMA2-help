# Color Picker  
  
![](https://i.ibb.co/JrTMf2f/image1.png)
  
This particular color picker is made to be implemented very fastly into a show file. Its strength resides in the fact that all images are directly generated by the script, so you don't need to import them manually.  
If you don't like images and prefer good ol' pool icons (for performances, or just because you prefer them), you can disable images.

Colors are fully customisable, you can edit, change or delete them as you want, you are not forced to used the default one provided. Also, you can specify swatchbook colors provided by MA.

## Installation  
Download *ColorPicker.lua* and *ColorPicker.xml* from GitHub and insert them into the plugin folder of a USB stick.  
In MA2, edit an empty plugin, click on *import* and select *ColorPicker.xml*.  
  
## Configuration  
In order to edit the config of the plugin, you will need a keyboard (the built-in one for light, full size and onPC is fine, you need an external one if you are using an Ultra Light, or a network connected onPC).  
  
### Groups  
The first step is to set the group that you want to include in your color picker.  
Add them between the brackets separated by comma.

You can create submaster groups by adding a sub-bracket group.

The sub-group will get its own masters that will react to the previous masters.

### First executor ID

This setting defines which executor will be used first. This plugin will need as many executors as you add groups. For example, if you include 5 groups in your color picker and want to use executor 2.106, you will need executor 2.106 thru 2.110 to be unused.

### Layout ID  
By default, the plugin will use layout 1. You can change it to any layout you want. Note however that the layout ID you will be using must be empty, otherwise the plugin won't work.

### Fade time between colors  
You can edit the fade time between two colors. By default, it equals to one second.

### Editing colors  
![](https://i.ibb.co/V2zjXsy/image12.png)
You can freely change the colors that are included in the color picker by editing the previous table. Be careful because a typo can cause the plugin to not work at all.  
Every color is defined by a row in the table. You can delete a color by deleting a row, or add a color by copy/pasting a row in the table.  
Every color has a name and RGB values (defined as percent). You can put anything you like as name, but you cannot have two colors with the same name.  
Additionally, you can use a swatchbook entry instead of a RGB value for a color.

You can use the full name (don't forget any quote or apostrophe or the plugin won't work) or the color number. It is always defined by *SwatchBookName.SwatchBookColorName* or *SwatchBookNumber.SwatchBookColorNumber*. Also, be careful to use the color number and not the color key.

### Enable/disable images  
By default, the plugin generates and uses images, but it is possible to disable them.

Change this setting to *false* to disable images.
